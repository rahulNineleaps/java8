can a default method be protected --> need to check that 

Learning -->
Before Java 8 if we wanted to add methods in an interface , they would be abstract , and it had to be implemented by all
the classes implementing the method . 
by introducing default method , this issue is resolved . and backwards compatablity is not broken .
But It introduces new problem , famously known as DDD(Deadly diamond of death )

DDD can be resolved by the class by overriding the inherited method.

Code shall be written ,later on .
